## Routes (to implement in html and ejs)

- `/category/list`: Displays a list of categories.
- `/category/form`: Displays the category edit/update form. TODO
- `/category/save`: Saves a new category to the database.

## SQL Injection Handling

- SQL queries should use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Testing

- We need unit tests for our application. Since it's not much code we could achieve 100% coverage or something close to that.
